1 When implementing a feature or component, reference the relevant sections of TDD.md and TechnicalPatterns.md. Update SessionHandoff.md with which patterns were applied at the end of development sessions.

2 Create and/or update timestamps in Eastern Time when creating or editing documentation. 

3 Write unit tests for all utility functions and store actions. Use React Testing Library for component tests, focusing on behavior rather than implementation details as specified in BestPractices.md Section 8.
