  ```

* Established naming conventions following TechnicalPatterns.md section 4.2:
  * Files: PascalCase for components, camelCase for non-components
  * Folders: camelCase for all folders
  * Components: PascalCase with component type included (e.g., `MessageList.tsx`)
  * Hooks: Prefixed with `use` (e.g., `useMessages.ts`)
  * Context: Suffixed with `Context` (e.g., `ThemeContext.tsx`)

* Created necessary directories with placeholder files (e.g. `.gitkeep`) to maintain the structure.
* Added proper documentation to each directory with README.md files explaining purpose and organization.

### Task 0.10: Create theme configuration (✅ Completed)
* Created the theme configuration in the `src/theme/` directory:
  ```
  src/theme/
  ├── index.ts     # Theme exports
  └── theme.ts     # Main theme configuration
  ```

* Implemented the theme configuration in `theme.ts`:
  * Defined TypeScript interfaces for extending the Material UI theme with custom status colors
  * Created a responsive theme with the following configurations:
    * Color palette with primary (blue), secondary (grey), and status colors
    * Consistent typography settings with standardized font sizes and weights
    * Component overrides for buttons, app bar, and cards
    * Proper spacing and shape configurations
  * Used the `responsiveFontSizes` helper for better mobile typography

* Created a complementary theme styles directory at `src/styles/theme/` for additional style customizations.

* Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation:
  * File headers with creation and update timestamps
  * Detailed documentation for interfaces and theme configuration.

### Task 0.11: Set up routing (✅ Completed)
* Implemented client-side routing using HashRouter for reliable navigation:
  * Created `src/routes/index.tsx` for centralized route definitions.
  * Implemented the router with createHashRouter from React Router v7.
  * Set up the following routes:
    * `/` - Redirects to home page
    * `/home` - Main home page
    * `/login` - Login form
    * `/register` - Registration form
    * `/chat` - Chat interface (placeholder)
    * `/history` - History view (placeholder)
    * `/settings` - Settings page (placeholder)
    * `*` - 404 page for handling invalid routes.

* Created a `LayoutWithErrorBoundary` wrapper component to provide consistent layout and error handling across all routes.

* Added placeholder components for future feature implementation.

* Documented the routing approach with comprehensive JSDoc comments, including:
  * File purpose and description
  * Creation and update timestamps
  * References to React Router documentation.

### Task 0.12: Create base HTML template (✅ Completed)
*   Based on `DevProgress.md`: Basic index.html with proper head section created.

### Task 0.13: Create global types (✅ Completed)

* Created essential global TypeScript type definition files in `app/src/types/`:
  * **`api.ts`**: Defines types for API interactions, including:
    * `ApiSuccessResponse<T>`: Standard structure for successful API responses.
    * `ApiErrorResponse`: Standard structure for API error responses.
    * `ApiResponse<T>`: Union type for success or error responses.
    * `PaginationInfo`: Interface for pagination metadata.
    * `PaginatedResponse<T>`: Type for responses that include paginated data.
  * **`common.ts`**: Contains common utility types used across the application:
    * `ID`: Represents unique identifiers (string or number).
    * `Timestamp`: Represents date/time strings or Date objects.
    * `LoadingState`: Enum-like type for tracking loading states ('idle', 'pending', 'succeeded', 'failed').
    * `KeyValuePairs<T>`: Generic type for key-value pair objects.
  * **`ui.ts`**: Defines types related to common UI elements and themes:
    * `ComponentSize`: ('small', 'medium', 'large').
    * `ThemeMode`: ('light', 'dark', 'system').
    * `TextAlignment`: ('left', 'center', 'right', 'justify').
    * `IconProps`: Basic interface for icon components (e.g., from Material UI or custom icons).
  * **`user.ts`**: Defines types related to user data and authentication state:
    * `UserProfile`: Interface for detailed user profile information (id, email, name, etc.).
    * `AuthState`: Interface for the authentication state slice in Zustand, including `isAuthenticated`, `user`, `authToken`, `authStatus`, and `authError`.
* All type files include comprehensive JSDoc comments for each type and property, and adhere to the project's documentation standards with correct file headers and timestamps.

### Task 0.14: Configure Zustand store (✅ Completed)

* **Implemented a comprehensive Zustand store setup:**
  * Created `app/src/store/store.types.ts` defining:
    * `AuthSliceState`, `AuthSliceActions`, and `AuthSlice` for authentication.
    * `SettingsSliceState`, `SettingsSliceActions`, and `SettingsSlice` for application settings.
    * `RootState` combining all slice types.
  * Created `app/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`:
    * Implemented `createAuthSlice` with initial state for `isAuthenticated`, `user`, `authToken`, `authStatus`, `authError`.
    * Added actions: `loginSuccess`, `logout`, `setAuthStatus`, `setAuthError`, `updateUserProfile`.
  * Created `app/src/store/slices/settingsSlice.ts`:
    * Implemented `createSettingsSlice` with initial state for `themeMode`, `mockApiEnabled`, `language`.
    * Added actions: `setThemeMode`, `toggleMockApi`, `setLanguage`.
  * Created `app/src/store/index.ts` as the main store entry point:
    * Combined `authSlice` and `settingsSlice` into the `useStore` hook.
    * Applied `immer` middleware for simplified immutable state updates.
    * Applied `persist` middleware (`zustand/middleware/persist`) to save and rehydrate selected state to `localStorage`.
      * Persisted state includes: `isAuthenticated`, `user`, `authToken` from auth slice, and `themeMode`, `mockApiEnabled`, `language` from settings slice, using the `partialize` option.
  * All created files adhere to project documentation standards, including JSDoc comments and file headers with correct timestamps.
  * The store is now ready for integration with components and API services.

### Task 0.15: Set up mock API client (✅ Completed)

**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Details:**

An initial mock API client has been created at `app/src/services/api/mockApiClient.ts`.
This client simulates backend interactions for development and testing purposes, aligning with the global types defined in `app/src/types/`.

**Key Features Implemented:**

1.  **Simulated Network Delay:** A `delay` function is included to mimic real network latency for a more realistic development experience.
2.  **Mock Authentication Functions:**
    *   `login(credentials)`: Simulates user login. Returns a mock `UserProfile` and `authToken` on success, or an error for invalid credentials.
    *   `logout()`: Simulates user logout, clearing the mock user and token.
    *   `register(details)`: Simulates new user registration. Returns a new `UserProfile` or an error if the email already exists.
3.  **Mock User Profile Function:**
    *   `fetchUserProfile()`: Simulates fetching the currently authenticated user's profile. Returns the `UserProfile` if a mock user is "logged in", otherwise returns an unauthenticated error.
4.  **Type Safety:** All mock functions return promises resolving to `ApiResponse<T>` (defined in `app/src/types/api.ts`), ensuring consistency with expected API response structures.
5.  **Basic State:** The mock client maintains a simple in-memory state for the `mockUser` and `mockAuthToken`.

**Unit Testing Setup (Jest):**

*   **Successful Configuration:** The Jest testing framework (`app/jest.config.cjs`) has been successfully configured to work with TypeScript (`ts-jest`) and the project's structure.
    *   Key fix involved correctly pathing `tsconfig.jest.json` within `ts-jest` options, ensuring it's relative to the project root.
    *   The `punycode` deprecation warning from Node during Jest execution is noted but does not affect test functionality at this time.
*   **Test File:** `app/src/services/api/mockApiClient.test.ts` created with comprehensive tests for all mock API functions:
    *   Tests cover successful login, login failure, logout, successful registration, registration with existing email, fetching user profile (authenticated and unauthenticated states).
    *   All tests are passing.

### Task 0.16: Create basic error handler (✅ Completed)
* Implemented a robust `ErrorBoundary` component in `src/components/common/ErrorBoundary.tsx`:
  * Created a class component extending React's Component class to catch JavaScript errors.
  * Implemented proper error state management with TypeScript interfaces.
  * Added comprehensive error UI with Material UI Alert component.
  * Included support for custom fallback UI through props.
  * Added error logging to console (with preparation for future error tracking service integration).

* Provided detailed TypeScript interfaces:
  * `ErrorBoundaryProps` - Props definition with children and optional fallback UI.
  * `ErrorBoundaryState` - State shape with hasError flag, error object, and errorInfo.

* Implemented React error handling lifecycle methods:
  * `getDerivedStateFromError` - Updates state when errors occur.
  * `componentDidCatch` - Logs errors and updates state with error information.

* Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation:
  * File purpose and component description
  * Detailed interface documentation
  * Method documentation with parameters and return values
  * Timestamps for creation and updates.

### Task 0.17: Set up logging utilities (✅ Completed)
*   **File Created:** `app/src/utils/logger.ts`
*   **Purpose:** Provides simple console logging utilities (`logInfo`, `logWarn`, `logError`) that only output messages when in development mode.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Uses a `LOG_PREFIX` (`[CoDirectorApp]`) for all messages.
    *   Development mode is determined by `IS_DEV_MODE`, initialized from `import.meta.env.DEV`.
    *   Includes `setDevMode(isDev: boolean)` function to allow manual override of `IS_DEV_MODE` for testing purposes.
    *   Adheres to JSDoc documentation standards, including file header with timestamps.
*   **Testing:**
    *   Unit tests created in `app/src/utils/__tests__/logger.test.ts`.
    *   Tests cover logging behavior in both development and production (simulated) modes using `setDevMode`.
    *   All tests pass.
*   **Updated:** 2025-05-23 14:53 ET

### Task 0.18: Create utility functions (🔄 In Progress)
*   Based on `DevProgress.md`: The initial utility, `logger.ts`, was created as part of Task 0.17.
*   Further common utility functions (e.g., for localStorage, formatting, validation) are pending development under this task.
*   Refer to Task 0.17 for details on the `logger.ts` utility.

### Task 0.21: Create common components (✅ Completed)
* Implemented key layout and common components:
  * `Layout.tsx` - Main application layout with responsive design
  * `AppBar.tsx` - Top navigation bar with mobile responsive menu
  * `Sidebar.tsx` - Navigation sidebar with collapsible design
  * `HomePage.tsx` - Landing page with feature sections
