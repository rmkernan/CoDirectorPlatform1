# Co-Director Platform: Implementation Updates

This document contains the updated implementation details for tasks that have been completed or are in progress according to DevProgress.md. These details should be merged into the main Implementation.md file.

## Updated Task Descriptions for Phase 0

### Task 0.9: Create folder structure (✅ Completed)

* Implemented the feature-based project structure following TechnicalPatterns.md section 4 with modifications to better suit the application needs:
  ```

  ```

* Established naming conventions following TechnicalPatterns.md section 4.2:
  * Files: PascalCase for components, camelCase for non-components
  * Folders: camelCase for all folders
  * Components: PascalCase with component type included (e.g., `MessageList.tsx`)
  * Hooks: Prefixed with `use` (e.g., `useMessages.ts`)
  * Context: Suffixed with `Context` (e.g., `ThemeContext.tsx`)

* Created necessary directories with placeholder files to maintain the structure
* Added proper documentation to each directory with README.md files explaining purpose and organization

### Task 0.10: Create theme configuration (✅ Completed)

* Created the theme configuration in the `src/theme/` directory:
  ```
  src/theme/
  ├── index.ts     # Theme exports
  └── theme.ts     # Main theme configuration
  ```

* Implemented the theme configuration in `theme.ts`:
  * Defined TypeScript interfaces for extending the Material UI theme with custom status colors
  * Created a responsive theme with the following configurations:
    * Color palette with primary (blue), secondary (grey), and status colors
    * Consistent typography settings with standardized font sizes and weights
    * Component overrides for buttons, app bar, and cards
    * Proper spacing and shape configurations
  * Used the `responsiveFontSizes` helper for better mobile typography

* Created a complementary theme styles directory at `src/styles/theme/` for additional style customizations

* Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation:
  * File headers with creation and update timestamps
  * Detailed documentation for interfaces and theme configuration

### Task 0.11: Set up routing (✅ Completed)

* Implemented client-side routing using HashRouter for reliable navigation:
  * Created `src/routes/index.tsx` for centralized route definitions
  * Implemented the router with createHashRouter from React Router v7
  * Set up the following routes:
    * `/` - Redirects to home page
    * `/home` - Main home page
    * `/login` - Login form
    * `/register` - Registration form
    * `/chat` - Chat interface (placeholder)
    * `/history` - History view (placeholder)
    * `/settings` - Settings page (placeholder)
    * `*` - 404 page for handling invalid routes

* Created a `LayoutWithErrorBoundary` wrapper component to provide consistent layout and error handling across all routes

* Added placeholder components for future feature implementation

* Documented the routing approach with comprehensive JSDoc comments, including:
  * File purpose and description
  * Creation and update timestamps
  * References to React Router documentation

### Task 0.13: Create global types (✅ Completed)

* Created essential global TypeScript type definition files in `app/src/types/`:
  * **`api.ts`**: Defines types for API interactions, including:
    * `ApiSuccessResponse<T>`: Standard structure for successful API responses.
    * `ApiErrorResponse`: Standard structure for API error responses.
    * `ApiResponse<T>`: Union type for success or error responses.
    * `PaginationInfo`: Interface for pagination metadata.
    * `PaginatedResponse<T>`: Type for responses that include paginated data.
  * **`common.ts`**: Contains common utility types used across the application:
    * `ID`: Represents unique identifiers (string or number).
    * `Timestamp`: Represents date/time strings or Date objects.
    * `LoadingState`: Enum-like type for tracking loading states ('idle', 'pending', 'succeeded', 'failed').
    * `KeyValuePairs<T>`: Generic type for key-value pair objects.
  * **`ui.ts`**: Defines types related to common UI elements and themes:
    * `ComponentSize`: ('small', 'medium', 'large').
    * `ThemeMode`: ('light', 'dark', 'system').
    * `TextAlignment`: ('left', 'center', 'right', 'justify').
    * `IconProps`: Basic interface for icon components (e.g., from Material UI or custom icons).
  * **`user.ts`**: Defines types related to user data and authentication state:
    * `UserProfile`: Interface for detailed user profile information (id, email, name, etc.).
    * `AuthState`: Interface for the authentication state slice in Zustand, including `isAuthenticated`, `user`, `authToken`, `authStatus`, and `authError`.
* All type files include comprehensive JSDoc comments for each type and property, and adhere to the project's documentation standards with correct file headers and timestamps.

### Task 0.14: Configure Zustand store (✅ Completed)

* **Implemented a comprehensive Zustand store setup:**
  * Created `app/src/store/store.types.ts` defining:
    * `AuthSliceState`, `AuthSliceActions`, and `AuthSlice` for authentication.
    * `SettingsSliceState`, `SettingsSliceActions`, and `SettingsSlice` for application settings.
    * `RootState` combining all slice types.
  * Created `app/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`:
    * Implemented `createAuthSlice` with initial state for `isAuthenticated`, `user`, `authToken`, `authStatus`, `authError`.
    * Added actions: `loginSuccess`, `logout`, `setAuthStatus`, `setAuthError`, `updateUserProfile`.
  * Created `app/src/store/slices/settingsSlice.ts`:
    * Implemented `createSettingsSlice` with initial state for `themeMode`, `mockApiEnabled`, `language`.
    * Added actions: `setThemeMode`, `toggleMockApi`, `setLanguage`.
  * Created `app/src/store/index.ts` as the main store entry point:
    * Combined `authSlice` and `settingsSlice` into the `useStore` hook.
    * Applied `immer` middleware for simplified immutable state updates.
    * Applied `persist` middleware (`zustand/middleware/persist`) to save and rehydrate selected state to `localStorage`.
      * Persisted state includes: `isAuthenticated`, `user`, `authToken` from auth slice, and `themeMode`, `mockApiEnabled`, `language` from settings slice, using the `partialize` option.
  * All created files adhere to project documentation standards, including JSDoc comments and file headers with correct timestamps.
  * The store is now ready for integration with components and API services.

### Task 0.15: Set up mock API client (🔄 In Progress)

* Created directory structure for API services:
  ```
  src/services/
  ├── api/              # API client and endpoints
  ├── mock/             # Mock API implementation
  └── localStorage/     # Local storage service
  ```

* Planned implementation details:
  * Create an API client with fetch or axios
  * Implement endpoints for authentication and data access
  * Add mock data for development and testing

* Next steps to complete this task:
  * Finish implementing the API client abstraction
  * Create mock data fixtures
  * Implement error handling and retry logic

### Task 0.16: Create basic error handler (✅ Completed)

* Implement an ErrorBoundary component for React error handling:
  * Create `src/components/common/ErrorBoundary.tsx`
  * Implement proper error state management
  * Create a user-friendly fallback UI with error details
  * Add options for error reporting and recovery

* Enhance error handling for async operations:
  * Implement try/catch patterns for API calls
  * Create standardized error response handling
  * Add error logging utilities

* Add error presentation components:
  * Create reusable error alert components
  * Implement different severity levels (error, warning, info)
  * Ensure accessibility with proper ARIA attributes

### Task 0.21: Create common components (✅ Completed)

* Implement a set of common UI components:
  * `src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx` - Main application layout
  * `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` - Application sidebar
  * `src/components/layout/AppBar.tsx` - Top navigation bar
  * `src/components/common/HomePage.tsx` - Home page content

* Create UI components following Material UI patterns:
  * Use proper responsive layouts with MUI Grid and Box
  * Implement consistent spacing and sizing
  * Ensure proper component styling using MUI's sx prop

* Enhance HomePage with comprehensive content sections:
  * Add feature overview sections
  * Implement getting started guidance
  * Add placeholder testimonials

* Implement responsive behavior:
  * Create mobile-friendly navigation
  * Add responsive breakpoints for different screen sizes
  * Implement smooth transitions for mobile menu

* Fix layout issues:
  * Correct sidebar overlap with main content
