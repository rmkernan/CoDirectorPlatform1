  ```

* Established naming conventions following TechnicalPatterns.md section 4.2:
  * Files: PascalCase for components, camelCase for non-components
  * Folders: camelCase for all folders
  * Components: PascalCase with component type included (e.g., `MessageList.tsx`)
  * Hooks: Prefixed with `use` (e.g., `useMessages.ts`)
  * Context: Suffixed with `Context` (e.g., `ThemeContext.tsx`)

* Created necessary directories with placeholder files to maintain the structure
* Added proper documentation to each directory with README.md files explaining purpose and organization

### Task 0.10: Create theme configuration (âœ… Completed)

* Created the theme configuration in the `src/theme/` directory:
  ```
  src/theme/
  â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts     # Theme exports
  â””â”€â”€ theme.ts     # Main theme configuration
  ```

* Implemented the theme configuration in `theme.ts`:
  * Defined TypeScript interfaces for extending the Material UI theme with custom status colors
  * Created a responsive theme with the following configurations:
    * Color palette with primary (blue), secondary (grey), and status colors
    * Consistent typography settings with standardized font sizes and weights
    * Component overrides for buttons, app bar, and cards
    * Proper spacing and shape configurations
  * Used the `responsiveFontSizes` helper for better mobile typography

* Created a complementary theme styles directory at `src/styles/theme/` for additional style customizations

* Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation:
  * File headers with creation and update timestamps
  * Detailed documentation for interfaces and theme configuration

### Task 0.11: Set up routing (âœ… Completed)

* Implemented client-side routing using HashRouter for reliable navigation:
  * Created `src/routes/index.tsx` for centralized route definitions
  * Implemented the router with createHashRouter from React Router v7
  * Set up the following routes:
    * `/` - Redirects to home page
    * `/home` - Main home page
    * `/login` - Login form
    * `/register` - Registration form
    * `/chat` - Chat interface (placeholder)
    * `/history` - History view (placeholder)
    * `/settings` - Settings page (placeholder)
    * `*` - 404 page for handling invalid routes

* Created a `LayoutWithErrorBoundary` wrapper component to provide consistent layout and error handling across all routes

* Added placeholder components for future feature implementation

* Documented the routing approach with comprehensive JSDoc comments, including:
  * File purpose and description
  * Creation and update timestamps
  * References to React Router documentation

### Task 0.13: Create global types (âœ… Completed)

* Created essential global TypeScript type definition files in `app/src/types/`:
  * **`api.ts`**: Defines types for API interactions, including:
    * `ApiSuccessResponse<T>`: Standard structure for successful API responses.
    * `ApiErrorResponse`: Standard structure for API error responses.
    * `ApiResponse<T>`: Union type for success or error responses.
    * `PaginationInfo`: Interface for pagination metadata.
    * `PaginatedResponse<T>`: Type for responses that include paginated data.
  * **`common.ts`**: Contains common utility types used across the application:
    * `ID`: Represents unique identifiers (string or number).
    * `Timestamp`: Represents date/time strings or Date objects.
    * `LoadingState`: Enum-like type for tracking loading states ('idle', 'pending', 'succeeded', 'failed').
    * `KeyValuePairs<T>`: Generic type for key-value pair objects.
  * **`ui.ts`**: Defines types related to common UI elements and themes:
    * `ComponentSize`: ('small', 'medium', 'large').
    * `ThemeMode`: ('light', 'dark', 'system').
    * `TextAlignment`: ('left', 'center', 'right', 'justify').
    * `IconProps`: Basic interface for icon components (e.g., from Material UI or custom icons).
  * **`user.ts`**: Defines types related to user data and authentication state:
    * `UserProfile`: Interface for detailed user profile information (id, email, name, etc.).
    * `AuthState`: Interface for the authentication state slice in Zustand, including `isAuthenticated`, `user`, `authToken`, `authStatus`, and `authError`.
* All type files include comprehensive JSDoc comments for each type and property, and adhere to the project's documentation standards with correct file headers and timestamps.

### Task 0.14: Configure Zustand store (âœ… Completed)

* **Implemented a comprehensive Zustand store setup:**
  * Created `app/src/store/store.types.ts` defining:
    * `AuthSliceState`, `AuthSliceActions`, and `AuthSlice` for authentication.
    * `SettingsSliceState`, `SettingsSliceActions`, and `SettingsSlice` for application settings.
    * `RootState` combining all slice types.
  * Created `app/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`:
    * Implemented `createAuthSlice` with initial state for `isAuthenticated`, `user`, `authToken`, `authStatus`, `authError`.
    * Added actions: `loginSuccess`, `logout`, `setAuthStatus`, `setAuthError`, `updateUserProfile`.
  * Created `app/src/store/slices/settingsSlice.ts`:
    * Implemented `createSettingsSlice` with initial state for `themeMode`, `mockApiEnabled`, `language`.
    * Added actions: `setThemeMode`, `toggleMockApi`, `setLanguage`.
  * Created `app/src/store/index.ts` as the main store entry point:
    * Combined `authSlice` and `settingsSlice` into the `useStore` hook.
    * Applied `immer` middleware for simplified immutable state updates.
    * Applied `persist` middleware (`zustand/middleware/persist`) to save and rehydrate selected state to `localStorage`.
      * Persisted state includes: `isAuthenticated`, `user`, `authToken` from auth slice, and `themeMode`, `mockApiEnabled`, `language` from settings slice, using the `partialize` option.
  * All created files adhere to project documentation standards, including JSDoc comments and file headers with correct timestamps.
  * The store is now ready for integration with components and API services.

### Task 0.15: Set up mock API client (ðŸ”„ In Progress)

* Created directory structure for API services:
  ```
  src/services/
  â”œâ”€â”€ api/              # API client and endpoints
  â”œâ”€â”€ mock/             # Mock API implementation
  â””â”€â”€ localStorage/     # Local storage service
  ```

* Planned implementation details:
  * Create an API client with fetch or axios
  * Implement endpoints for authentication and data access
  * Add mock data for development and testing

* Next steps to complete this task:
  * Finish implementing the API client abstraction
  * Create mock data fixtures
  * Implement error handling and retry logic

### Task 0.16: Create basic error handler (âœ… Completed)

  * Add error logging utilities

* Add error presentation components:
  * Create reusable error alert components
  * Implement different severity levels (error, warning, info)
  * Ensure accessibility with proper ARIA attributes

### Task 0.21: Create common components (âœ… Completed)

* Implement a set of common UI components:
  * `src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx` - Main application layout

  * Ensure proper component styling using MUI's sx prop

* Enhance HomePage with comprehensive content sections:
  * Add feature overview sections
  * Implement getting started guidance
