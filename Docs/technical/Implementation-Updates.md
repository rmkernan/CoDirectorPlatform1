  ```

* Established naming conventions following TechnicalPatterns.md section 4.2:
  * Files: PascalCase for components, camelCase for non-components
  * Folders: camelCase for all folders
  * Components: PascalCase with component type included (e.g., `MessageList.tsx`)
  * Hooks: Prefixed with `use` (e.g., `useMessages.ts`)
  * Context: Suffixed with `Context` (e.g., `ThemeContext.tsx`)

* Created necessary directories with placeholder files (e.g. `.gitkeep`) to maintain the structure.
* Added proper documentation to each directory with README.md files explaining purpose and organization.

### Task 0.10: Create theme configuration (âœ… Completed)
* Created the theme configuration in the `src/theme/` directory:
  ```
  src/theme/
  â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts     # Theme exports
  â””â”€â”€ theme.ts     # Main theme configuration
  ```

* Implemented the theme configuration in `theme.ts`:
  * Defined TypeScript interfaces for extending the Material UI theme with custom status colors
  * Created a responsive theme with the following configurations:
    * Color palette with primary (blue), secondary (grey), and status colors
    * Consistent typography settings with standardized font sizes and weights
    * Component overrides for buttons, app bar, and cards
    * Proper spacing and shape configurations
  * Used the `responsiveFontSizes` helper for better mobile typography

* Created a complementary theme styles directory at `src/styles/theme/` for additional style customizations.

* Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation:
  * File headers with creation and update timestamps
  * Detailed documentation for interfaces and theme configuration.

### Task 0.11: Set up routing (âœ… Completed)
* Implemented client-side routing using HashRouter for reliable navigation:
  * Created `src/routes/index.tsx` for centralized route definitions.
  * Implemented the router with createHashRouter from React Router v7.
  * Set up the following routes:
    * `/` - Redirects to home page
    * `/home` - Main home page
    * `/login` - Login form
    * `/register` - Registration form
    * `/chat` - Chat interface (placeholder)
    * `/history` - History view (placeholder)
    * `/settings` - Settings page (placeholder)
    * `*` - 404 page for handling invalid routes.

* Created a `LayoutWithErrorBoundary` wrapper component to provide consistent layout and error handling across all routes.

* Added placeholder components for future feature implementation.

* Documented the routing approach with comprehensive JSDoc comments, including:
  * File purpose and description
  * Creation and update timestamps
  * References to React Router documentation.

### Task 0.12: Create base HTML template (âœ… Completed)
*   Based on `DevProgress.md`: Basic index.html with proper head section created.

### Task 0.14: Configure Zustand store (ðŸ”„ In Progress)
* Created the basic structure for the Zustand store:
  * Prepared `src/store/` directory structure.
  * Created subdirectories for store slices (e.g. `app/src/store/slices/` with a `.gitkeep` file to ensure the directory is tracked, as per MEMORY[b839f6e0-11ab-440f-9f9e-d02a200c6f99]).

* Planned store implementation details:
  * State management for user authentication
  * State management for application settings
  * State management for chat interactions

* Next steps to complete this task:
  * Implement the base store configuration.
  * Create individual store slices for different features.
  * Add persistence layer for relevant state.

* Example slice structure for `userSlice.ts` and `chatSlice.ts` (as placeholders for actual feature slices).
* State persistence strategy:
  * Integrated `zustand/middleware/persist` for saving and rehydrating state from `localStorage`.
  * Configured persistence for specific slices that require it (e.g., `userSettingsSlice`, `chatHistorySlice`).
* Connect store to components:
  * General pattern: Components will use selectors to subscribe to specific parts of the store state, ensuring re-renders only when relevant data changes. Example: `const MOCK_API_ENABLED = useStore(state => state.devSettings.MOCK_API_ENABLED);`

### Task 0.15: Set up mock API client (ðŸ”„ In Progress)
* Created directory structure for API services:
  ```
  src/services/
  â”œâ”€â”€ __mocks__/         # Mock implementations for testing
  â”œâ”€â”€ api/               # Actual API client implementations
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ authApi.ts     # Authentication related API calls
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ chatApi.ts     # Chat related API calls
  â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts           # Exports for API services
  â””â”€â”€ types.ts           # Common types for API services
  ```
* Initial planning for mock data and service structure is underway.

### Task 0.16: Create basic error handler (âœ… Completed)
* Implemented a robust `ErrorBoundary` component in `src/components/common/ErrorBoundary.tsx`:
  * Created a class component extending React's Component class to catch JavaScript errors.
  * Implemented proper error state management with TypeScript interfaces.
  * Added comprehensive error UI with Material UI Alert component.
  * Included support for custom fallback UI through props.
  * Added error logging to console (with preparation for future error tracking service integration).

* Provided detailed TypeScript interfaces:
  * `ErrorBoundaryProps` - Props definition with children and optional fallback UI.
  * `ErrorBoundaryState` - State shape with hasError flag, error object, and errorInfo.

* Implemented React error handling lifecycle methods:
  * `getDerivedStateFromError` - Updates state when errors occur.
  * `componentDidCatch` - Logs errors and updates state with error information.

* Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation:
  * File purpose and component description
  * Detailed interface documentation
  * Method documentation with parameters and return values
  * Timestamps for creation and updates.

### Task 0.17: Set up logging utilities (âœ… Completed)
*   **File Created:** `app/src/utils/logger.ts`
*   **Purpose:** Provides simple console logging utilities (`logInfo`, `logWarn`, `logError`) that only output messages when in development mode.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Uses a `LOG_PREFIX` (`[CoDirectorApp]`) for all messages.
    *   Development mode is determined by `IS_DEV_MODE`, initialized from `import.meta.env.DEV`.
    *   Includes `setDevMode(isDev: boolean)` function to allow manual override of `IS_DEV_MODE` for testing purposes.
    *   Adheres to JSDoc documentation standards, including file header with timestamps.
*   **Testing:**
    *   Unit tests created in `app/src/utils/__tests__/logger.test.ts`.
    *   Tests cover logging behavior in both development and production (simulated) modes using `setDevMode`.
    *   All tests pass.
*   **Updated:** 2025-05-23 14:53 ET

### Task 0.18: Create utility functions (ðŸ”„ In Progress)
*   Based on `DevProgress.md`: The initial utility, `logger.ts`, was created as part of Task 0.17.
*   Further common utility functions (e.g., for localStorage, formatting, validation) are pending development under this task.
*   Refer to Task 0.17 for details on the `logger.ts` utility.

### Task 0.21: Create common components (âœ… Completed)
* Implemented key layout and common components:
  * `Layout.tsx` - Main application layout with responsive design
  * `AppBar.tsx` - Top navigation bar with mobile responsive menu
  * `Sidebar.tsx` - Navigation sidebar with collapsible design
  * `HomePage.tsx` - Landing page with feature sections

* Added UI improvements as noted in the UI/UX documentation:
  * Fixed layout issues where sidebar overlapped with main content
  * Added smooth transitions for mobile menu
  * Enhanced responsive behavior across different screen sizes
  * Added proper scrolling functionality with fixed header and sidebar

* Ensured all components follow the project's documentation standards:
  * Comprehensive JSDoc annotations and file headers
  * Consistent documentation style across the codebase
  * Proper TypeScript interfaces for component props
