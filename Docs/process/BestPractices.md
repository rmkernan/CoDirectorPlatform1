## 1. Code Organization

### Folder Structure
- Follow the [project folder structure](./TechnicalPatterns.md#4-project-folder-structure) defined in the Technical Patterns document.
- Group related files by feature rather than by file type.

### Naming Conventions
- **Files**: 
  - React components: PascalCase (e.g., `MessageItem.tsx`)
  - Hooks, utilities, contexts: camelCase (e.g., `useMessages.ts`, `formatDate.ts`)
- **Folders**: Always use camelCase (e.g., `components`, `hooks`, `utils`)
- **Components**: Use descriptive names that indicate purpose (e.g., `SessionCard.tsx`, not just `Card.tsx`)
- **Functions**: Use verb phrases for actions (e.g., `fetchSession`, `formatTimestamp`)

### Imports
- Order imports: React/libraries first, followed by components, then utilities/types
- Use absolute imports with path aliases when available (e.g., `@/components` instead of `../../../components`)
- Destructure imports when appropriate (e.g., `import { Button, TextField } from '@mui/material'`)

## 2. File and Function Size

### File Length
- Limit files to **400 lines of code** maximum.
- If a file exceeds this limit, consider splitting it into multiple files.
- Exceptions can be made for complex components, but these should be rare and documented.

### Function Length
- Keep functions under **40 lines** of code.
- If a function grows larger, refactor into smaller, more focused functions.
- Each function should have a single responsibility.

### Component Complexity
- Limit component nesting to 3-4 levels deep.
- If a component requires many nested conditionals, consider refactoring or creating helper components.

## 3. Component Design

### Single Responsibility
- Each component should do one thing well.
- Break complex components into smaller, more manageable pieces.

### Prop Management
- Use TypeScript interfaces to define props.
- Provide default values for optional props.
- Destructure props at the top of the component.
- Use prop spreading sparingly and only when appropriate.

```typescript
// Good practice
interface ButtonProps {
  label: string;
  onClick: () => void;
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary';
}

const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ 
  label, 
  onClick, 
  variant = 'primary' 
}) => {
  // Component implementation
};
```

### Component Organization
- Define props interface at the top of the file
- Place hooks and state declarations next
- Define event handlers and other functions before the return statement
- Keep JSX clean and readable
- Extract complex JSX into separate components or variables

## 4. TypeScript Guidelines

### Type Safety
- Enable strict mode in `tsconfig.json`.
- Avoid using `any` type. If necessary, use more specific types like `unknown`.
- Use TypeScript's utility types (e.g., `Partial<T>`, `Pick<T, K>`, `Omit<T, K>`) when appropriate.

### Type Definitions
- Define interfaces for component props, state objects, and API responses.
- Use discriminated unions for complex state management.
- Place shared types in the `types` directory.
- Place feature-specific types within the feature directory.

### Type Guards
- Use type guards to handle different data shapes safely.
- Create reusable type guards for common patterns.

```typescript
// Example type guard
function isSessionResponse(data: unknown): data is SessionResponse {
  return (
    typeof data === 'object' && 
    data !== null && 
    'sessionId' in data && 
    'messages' in data
  );
}
```

## 5. State Management

### Zustand Usage
- Follow the patterns defined in the [Zustand State Management section](./TechnicalPatterns.md#6-zustand-state-management-patterns) of the Technical Patterns document.
- Create separate store slices for different features.
- Keep store slices small and focused.
- Use TypeScript to type store state and actions.

### Local vs. Global State
- Use local component state for UI-specific state that doesn't need to be shared.
- Use Zustand for state that needs to be shared across components.
- Avoid prop drilling; use context or store when props need to pass through multiple levels.

### Side Effects
- Handle side effects (API calls, localStorage, etc.) within store actions, not components.
- Use try/catch for error handling in async actions.
- Update loading/error states appropriately.

## 6. Performance Optimization

### Component Optimization
- Use `React.memo()` for components that render often but rarely change.
- Use `useCallback()` for event handlers passed to child components.
- Use `useMemo()` for expensive calculations.

### Render Performance
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders by using memoization techniques.
- Use virtualization for long lists (e.g., message history).
- Implement lazy loading for components that aren't immediately needed.

```typescript
// Example virtualization
import { FixedSizeList } from 'react-window';

function MessageList({ messages }) {
  return (
    <FixedSizeList
      height={500}
      width="100%"
      itemCount={messages.length}
      itemSize={80}
    >
      {({ index, style }) => (
        <div style={style}>
          <MessageItem message={messages[index]} />
        </div>
      )}
    </FixedSizeList>
  );
}
```

### Bundle Size
- Use code splitting to reduce initial load time.
- Import only the components you need from libraries (e.g., `import { Button } from '@mui/material'` instead of `import * as MUI from '@mui/material'`).
- Regularly analyze bundle size with tools like `webpack-bundle-analyzer`.

## 7. Error Handling

### Error Boundaries
- Use React error boundaries to catch and handle rendering errors.
- Implement custom error boundary components for different parts of the application.

### API Error Handling
- Implement consistent error handling for API requests.
- Display user-friendly error messages.
- Log detailed errors for debugging.
- Handle network failures gracefully.

### Form Validation
- Validate form inputs before submission.
- Provide clear error messages for form validation errors.
- Use a consistent approach to form state management.

## 8. Testing

### Unit Tests
- Write unit tests for utility functions, hooks, and store actions.
- Aim for at least 80% test coverage for critical code paths.
- Use Jest for unit testing.

### Component Tests
- Test components with React Testing Library.
- Focus on testing behavior, not implementation details.
- Write tests that simulate user interactions.

### Test Organization
- Place tests close to the code they test (e.g., `Component.test.tsx` alongside `Component.tsx`).
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior.
- Group related tests with `describe` blocks.

```typescript
// Example test organization
describe('SessionCard', () => {
  it('displays the session title and date', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
  
  it('calls onSelect when clicked', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
  
  describe('when in edit mode', () => {
    it('shows edit controls', () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
```

## 9. Accessibility

### ARIA and Semantic HTML
- Use semantic HTML elements (`button`, `nav`, `article`, etc.) when appropriate.
- Add ARIA attributes when semantic HTML isn't sufficient.
- Ensure all interactive elements have appropriate roles and states.

### Keyboard Navigation
- Ensure all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard.
- Implement proper tab order with `tabIndex` when necessary.
- Test keyboard navigation regularly.

### Color and Contrast
- Maintain sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA compliance at minimum).
- Don't rely solely on color to convey information.
- Test with color blindness simulators.

## 10. Security

### Input Validation
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
- Never trust client-side validation alone; implement server-side validation as well.
- Use input validation libraries like Zod or Yup.

### Dependency Management
- Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
- Use tools like `npm audit` to check for known vulnerabilities.
- Be cautious about adding new dependencies.

### Environment Variables
- Store sensitive information in environment variables.
- Never commit sensitive information to version control.
- Use different environment configurations for development and production.

## 11. Version Control

### Commit Convention
- Use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard for all commit messages
- Format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
- Examples:
  ```
  feat(chat): implement message display component
  fix(setup): resolve principles document loading issue
  docs: update README with setup instructions
  refactor(store): simplify session state management
  ```
- Keep commits small, focused, and logically atomic
- Include task/issue references when applicable (`Task 1.3: Setup View`)

### Branching Strategy
- Follow the GitHub Flow model with semantic branch naming
- Branch naming convention: `<type>/<task-id>-<short-description>`
- Types:
  - `feature/*` - New functionality (e.g., `feature/0-9-folder-structure`)
  - `bugfix/*` - Bug fixes (e.g., `bugfix/message-display-overflow`)
  - `refactor/*` - Code improvements without functional changes
  - `docs/*` - Documentation updates only
  - `release/*` - Release preparation branches
- Always branch from `main` for new features
- Keep branches up to date with `main` using rebase

### Git Workflow
- Create a new branch when starting a new task
- Commit regularly as logical units of work are completed
- Push to GitHub daily for backup and collaboration
- Before completing a task:
  1. Ensure tests and linting pass
  2. Rebase on latest `main` if needed
  3. Push final changes

### Pull Requests
- Create focused PRs that implement a single feature or fix
- Use the PR template to ensure all information is provided
- Include:
  - Clear description of changes
  - Link to related task in DevProgress.md
  - Completed code quality checklist
  - Screenshots for UI changes
- Request reviews from appropriate team members
- Address review comments promptly
- Use "Squash and merge" when merging to keep `main` history clean

### Git Context in Development Tracking
- Include Git context in SessionHandoff.md entries:
  ```
  ### Git & Version Control Context
  * Current Branch: [branch name]
  * Latest Commit: [commit hash and message]
  * Related PR: [PR link if applicable]
  * CI Status: [passing/failing]
  ```
- Reference the complete Git workflow in `Docs/process/GitWorkflow.md`

## 12. Code Reviews

### Review Process
- Review all code changes before merging to the main branch.
- Use a consistent review checklist.
- Be constructive and specific in review comments.
- Focus on code quality, not style preferences (let linters handle style).

### Review Checklist
- Does the code follow the project's best practices?
- Are there appropriate tests for the changes?
- Is the code well-documented?
- Are there any potential performance issues?
- Are there any security concerns?
- Is the code accessible?
- Does the code handle errors appropriately?

These best practices are guidelines, not rigid rules. Use judgment and adapt them to specific situations as needed. The goal is to create high-quality, maintainable code that meets the project's requirements.

When in doubt, prioritize readability and maintainability over cleverness or brevity.
