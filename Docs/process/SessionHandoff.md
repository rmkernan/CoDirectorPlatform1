## Current Session Handoffs

### Handoff 2025-05-22, 02:48 PM ET

#### Session Summary
* **Session Start:** 2025-05-22, 01:30 PM ET
* **Session End:** 2025-05-22, 02:48 PM ET
* **Duration:** 1:18 hours
* **Focus Areas:** Project documentation, implementation patterns, development best practices
* **Key Accomplishments:** 
  - Created TechnicalPatterns.md with implementation patterns for TypeScript, Vite, Material UI, React, and Zustand
  - Created BestPractices.md with development guidelines and standards
  - Updated SessionHandoff.md to reference new documentation
  - Created focused memories for folder structure and component patterns

#### Current Development State
* **Current Phase:** Phase 0: Project Setup
* **Completed Tasks:** None (Pre-implementation)
* **In-Progress Tasks:** None
* **Next Tasks:** 
  - Task 0.1: Initialize Vite project
  - Task 0.2: Install dependencies
  - Task 0.3: Install Material UI
  - Task 0.4: Install Zustand
  - Task 0.5: Install testing libraries

#### Implementation Context
* **Key Files Created:**
  - `Docs/technical/TechnicalPatterns.md`: Implementation patterns and code examples
  - `Docs/process/BestPractices.md`: Development guidelines and standards
* **Previous Files:**
  - `Docs/technical/TDD.md`: Comprehensive Technical Design Document
  - `Docs/technical/TDD-Index.md`: Navigation aid for the TDD
  - `Docs/technical/Implementation.md`: Implementation plan with task breakdown
  - `Docs/process/DevProgress.md`: Progress tracking with status indicators
  - `Docs/process/SessionHandoff.md`: Session handoff log (this file)
* **Critical Dependencies:** None yet (pre-implementation)
* **State Management:** Defined in TDD and TechnicalPatterns.md but not yet implemented

#### Technical Patterns & Practices Reference
* **Relevant Patterns:** 
  - Vite Configuration: ../technical/TechnicalPatterns.md Section 2
  - Project Folder Structure: ../technical/TechnicalPatterns.md Section 4
  - Zustand State Management: ../technical/TechnicalPatterns.md Section 6
* **Applied Best Practices:**
  - File and Function Size: ./BestPractices.md Section 2
  - Code Organization: ./BestPractices.md Section 1

#### Decisions & Challenges
* **Technical Decisions:**
  - Created separate BestPractices.md document rather than adding to TechnicalPatterns.md
  - Created focused memories for most-used implementation patterns
* **Open Questions:**
  - None at this stage
* **Known Issues:**
  - None at this stage

#### TDD Reference
* **Relevant TDD Sections for Next Tasks:**
  - Task 0.1-0.5: See TDD Section 6.1 (TypeScript Best Practices), lines 1950-2020

#### Required Actions for Next Session
1. Initialize the project repository with the first tasks from Phase 0
2. Refer to the Implementation Plan for detailed task requirements
3. Use the TDD-Index to efficiently reference relevant technical specifications
4. Follow the folder structure defined in TechnicalPatterns.md
5. Adhere to the guidelines in BestPractices.md
